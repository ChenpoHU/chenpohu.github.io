               <p>As a member of Start Berlin, I help to organise differient events to connect startups, founders, entrepreneurs and students.</p>
               <p>We organised the students in Berlin a travel with START Berlin to Tel Aviv and let them join our exciting Israel Entrepreneurship Tour. The 5 day program had introduced the students to the Israeli start-up scene. Our partner, the College of Management Academic Studies, had helped to finalizing the schedule – including a trip to Jerusalem!</p> 
               <p>The startup ecosystem of Tel Aviv is one of the biggest in the world. The main difference to Berlin is the focus of the companies: Israel's startups are more hich-tech and IoT companies, while Berlin is focusing on rapidly growing E-commerce businesses.
We visited Roomer and FairFly, who disrupt the travel market with data and market access, The Junction Tel Aviv's world-famous accelerator program and coworking spaces like Merkspace, Power-ball פאוורבול and SOSA. They host startups like Spitball and Slyde that yet have to raise money and become famous.Amazingly, lots of founders choose to build a startup direct after the serving of the army in Israel. 
Israel founders are really very brave and have the tendency to take more risks, just as what people alwasys say.</p>
               <p> In Israel we visited a place, where people with a big pocket help those with a big heart. Too idealistic to be the truth? Tech For Good Israel proves the contrary. Uniting venture capitalists, mentors and promising social enterpreneurs they transform technologies into the means of help for children, seniors and other challenged categories. As a result hundreds of lives are improved and millions of profit achieved.</p>     
               <p> One of the biggest Israeli startups Taboola​ cleared up the mystery of human's preferences and showed how they achieve millions of profit providing users with targeted information and businesses with new customers.</p>

//Our new event Startup Insights, organised together with Humboldt-Forum Wirtschaft e.V. was a great success! 3 speakers, who experienced startup failure in the past, were openly talking about the darkest days of business life. More than 150 visitors learned a lot about company failure and bankruptcy prevention. Some of the recommendations were really unexpected! 
Maciek Laskus: "Separate your personal and startup identity. And take holidays!" 
Marc Clemens: " Timing is very important, don't be too late to catch the investment trend. And you can always discuss business conditions with investors. They are already prepared for your failure" 
Max von Waldenfels: " The main reason of failure are wrong people in your team, not a bad strategy or a product. Be transparent with your team and investors. And pitch your ideas as much as possible. Nobody will steal them!" 
More startup insights can be found on YouTube soon. Follow us there and come to the new Startup Insights event in three months! #startupinsights
