               <h2> 3D Measurement of Large Obejcts </h2>
               <p>This is a university projects of University of Potsdam and Technische Universität Berlin. In collaboration with Siemens AG and aims at providing insights and future scenarios for the tech-nology – 3D measurement of large components.
                  In order to be able to deliver the assigned goals, our team encompassing 4 students from TU Berlin and Uni Potsdam was formed. </p> 
                    
               <p>In order to prepare a proper report the research was divided. All members studied literature and websites of organizations related to the investigated technology. These actions facilitated a prepa-ration for the first interview with a representative of Siemens AG. Having gathered basic infor-mation about the different technologies concerning 3D measurement, as well as applications and market players from both literatures and the interview, it turned out that the research should con-centrate more on certain 3D measurement methods such as laser triangulation, structured light, photogrammetry and CT. Additionally, the research should focus on large components which is defined here as an object larger than 2 meters height and a diameter of 1 meter. After the first research, a first discussion about key drivers took place. On the basis of the findings, 5 key drivers out of 21 were derived with the help of the software EIDOS.</p>
               

               <p>Subsequently, appropriate companies related to the 3D measurement market were searched. We managed to get in contact with 3D measurement experts from 7 different companies - manufac-turers such as GOM, AICON, Zeiss, research institutions - Measurement in Motion, TU Berlin 3D Lab and 3D measurement service providers - Schenk&Steindorf GbR, ARGON MS GmbH. Six telephone interviews were conducted and one interview was delivered through email. The interviews result-ed in perceiving technology drivers in a slightly different approach than it was expected. Therefore, some of the key drivers were needed to be reformulated. Having made a decision about changing two drivers, the interviews with GOM and AICON were conducted. These conversations in fact supported the final set of key drivers. Furthermore, in order to find consistent scenarios, a matrix analysis in EIDOS was conducted According to three established scenarios, strategic recommenda-tions were formed.</p>

               <p>And I have some friends who want to build a software startup in the future or have already built one. Besides I see that it´s really not easy to be a founder but it´s very inspiring.  Last but not least, me too, want to build a startup by my own. So I designed this Research Project in my research seminar to find a model that could help software startups to identify the biggest risks early. Hopefully that the final model will help software startups to increase their success rate.</p> 

               <p>You can find the research design below.</p>

               <p>The goal of this study is to develop a model to help software startups to be able to identify the risks that lead software startups to fail. In particular, the focus is on cutting-edge software startups. First of all, The first version of the risk identification model is done after the literature research and several small interviews in the startup events in Berlin and startup tour in Israel. X workshops were done with A failed software startups, Y successful startups and Z restarted startups.   The risk identification model will evolve into a new version every time after each workshop. With the continual improvement after X workshops we get the final risk identification model. </p>
               <p>  I am excited about our work together! Risk identification is the first step of risk management. If this project runs well, I will work on a new risk management model for software startups on my master thesis  next semester. It will be more and more meaningful for us. </p>
