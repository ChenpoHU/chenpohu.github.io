               <p>As a member of Start Berlin, I help to organise differient events to connect startups, founders, entrepreneurs and students.</p>
               <p>We organised the students in Berlin a travel with START Berlin to Tel Aviv and let them join our exciting Israel Entrepreneurship Tour. The 5 day program had introduced the students to the Israeli start-up scene. Our partner, the College of Management Academic Studies, had helped to finalizing the schedule – including a trip to Jerusalem!</p> 
               <p>The startup ecosystem of Tel Aviv is one of the biggest in the world. The main difference to Berlin is the focus of the companies: Israel's startups are more hich-tech and IoT companies, while Berlin is focusing on rapidly growing E-commerce businesses.
                  We visited Roomer and FairFly, who disrupt the travel market with data and market access, The Junction Tel Aviv's world-famous accelerator program and coworking spaces like Merkspace, Power-ball פאוורבול and SOSA. They host startups like Spitball and Slyde that yet have to raise money and become famous.Amazingly, lots of founders choose to build a startup direct after the serving of the army in Israel. 
                  Israel founders are really very brave and have the tendency to take more risks, just as what people always say.</p>
