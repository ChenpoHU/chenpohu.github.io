               <h2> The Software Startup Risk Identification Model: A Framework  to identify the potential risks  that lead  Software Startups to fail </h2>
               <p>Hey, guys, welcome to visit the homepage of the risk identification model for software startups. I appreciate very much your cooperation.</p> 
                    
               <p>Most markets for software are global in scope and become dominated by a handful of products, so there are significant opportunities for long term profits and growth for a company bringing the right product to market. (Crowne, 2002)</p>

               <p>BUT: The probability of failure for startups is high (Crowne, 2002; Kerr et al., 2014; CB Insights, 2014; SBA Office of Advocacy, 2016)</p>

               <p>And I have some friends who want to build a software startup in the future or have already built one. Besides I see that it´s really not easy to be a founder but it´s very inspiring.  Last but not least, me too, want to build a startup by my own. So I designed this Research Project in my research seminar to find a model that could help software startups to identify the biggest risks early. Hopefully that the final model will help software startups to increase their success rate.</p> 

               <p>You can find the research design below.</p>
               <h3>visualisation of the research design</h3>
               <img class="imgoi" src="visualisation of the research design.jpg" alt="visualisation of the research design" style="width:608px;height:456px;text-align:center;" >
               <p>The goal of this study is to develop a model to help software startups to be able to identify the risks that lead software startups to fail. In particular, the focus is on cutting-edge software startups. First of all, The first version of the risk identification model is done after the literature research and several small interviews in the startup events in Berlin and startup tour in Israel. X workshops were done with A failed software startups, Y successful startups and Z restarted startups.   The risk identification model will evolve into a new version every time after each workshop. With the continual improvement after X workshops we get the final risk identification model. </p>
               <p>  I am excited about our work together! Risk identification is the first step of risk management. If this project runs well, I will work on a new risk management model for software startups on my master thesis  next semester. It will be more and more meaningful for us. </p>
